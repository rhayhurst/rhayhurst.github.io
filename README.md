Ongoing project for IBEIS (http://ibeis.org/wordpress/).  We've created a UI that allows users to upload photographs to the IBEIS database.  

Besides just uploading the photo, the user can also provide meta-data -- longitude and latitude of where the photo was taken, date/time, and a description of the subject(s).  

This open-source database can be used for scientists all over the globe to futher conservationist goals.

Thanks to Tanya Berger-Wolf for her assistance with this project.
